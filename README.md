### COVID19-Analysis-With-R

This project utilizes the R language to offer a detailed analysis of global COVID-19 vaccination data. 
We explore vaccination rates considering factors like population, vaccine types, regions, and income, applying diverse sampling methods to gauge their impact on data interpretation. 
Key undertakings include validating the Central Limit Theorem through histograms and examining the bootstrap bias estimate in relation to sample size and deviation.
