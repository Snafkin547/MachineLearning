## Projects

### COVID19-Analysis-With-R

This project utilizes the R language to offer a detailed analysis of global COVID-19 vaccination data. 
We explore vaccination rates considering factors like population, vaccine types, regions, and income, applying diverse sampling methods to gauge their impact on data interpretation. 
Key undertakings include validating the Central Limit Theorem through histograms and examining the bootstrap bias estimate in relation to sample size and deviation.

### Drive-Assistant

This project is a component of a broader project aimed at enhancing road safety through image recognition. 
It houses a custom version of the GoogLeNet architecture, fine-tuned for the Drive Assistant system to detect potholes with 88.46% accuracy. 
Notable features include a modified GoogLeNet for better detection, a curated dataset with labeled road images, and the use of data augmentation and regularization to boost model efficacy and mitigate overfitting. 
For a comprehensive understanding of the modelâ€™s design, effectiveness, and application, users are directed to the README file in this sub-repository.
